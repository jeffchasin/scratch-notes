# Scratch Notes

Make quick notes in a browser tab, save in `localStorage`. Light & dark mode based on `prefers-color-scheme`, with theme switcher toggle.

Can be used from a local folder in Chrome latest (as of today). On a Mac the URL is like `file:///Users/[username]/path/to/this/folder/index.html`.  But there may be security warnings or issues depending on browser or settings, more [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage#exceptions). 

Can also be used with [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) or other local server utility. Run `npx serve` from the folder, for example or learn more about a [local server setup](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server).

## Disclaimer
